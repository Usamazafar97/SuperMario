# SuperMario
A 3 Leveled Super MArio Game Built on masm615

##General Overview:
The Overall Project has been successfully completed and all the
requirements are met. In addition, significant work has been done
on the interface and extra innovative ideas have also been
implemented.
We have successfully completed all the phases of the project. We
have displayed the obstacles and flag and Mario, Enemy, Castle,
Coin and dragon. We have used the concept of arrays in our
project in which we have stored the colour of pixels in arrays and
printed those pixels using a 2-d Array. For left and right
movement, we are using the LEFT, RIGHT UP and Down keys for
the movement of the Mario. We have used the interrupt 13h with
screen resolution of 320x200 .We have tried our level best to do
as much as possible for us to do and hope for the good and
better marks.
